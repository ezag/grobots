----- Building -----

So far Grobots has only been built using MrCpp 5.x under MPW, using STLport
for the standard library. To build it in this environment, put src, an
empty folder called "ObjectFiles", and an alias to :src:mac:Grobots.make in
a folder, make it the current directory, and run "BuildProgram Grobots".

If you can build Grobots in another environment, we want your makefiles (or
local equivalent).

See source.html on either website for info on porting Grobots to other platforms.
We are interested in portability patches, even incomplete ones.


Have fun.
