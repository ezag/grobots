----- Building under MPW -----

The Mac version of Grobots can be built under MPW, using STLport
for the standard library and MrCpp 5.x as the compiler. Once you
have installed these (STLport may be hard), make this directory
structure somewhere:

Grobots:
	src: (the decompressed source tree)
	ObjectFiles:
		Carbon: (empty)
		Classic: (empty)
		Tool: (empty)
	GrobotsClassic.make (alias to :src:mac:GrobotsClassic.make)
	GrobotsCarbon.make (alias to :src:mac:GrobotsCarbon.make)
	GrobotsTool.make (alias to :src:mac:GrobotsTool.make)

Then run MPW, make Grobots the current directory, and run
"BuildProgram GrobotsClassic" (or another target name).

----- Building under MSVC -----

The Windows versions (regular and headless) can be built under
Microsoft Visual C++ 6. Open win/Grobots.dsw and everything should work.

The compiler may die of an internal error when building with full optimizations on.

----- Building on Linux -----

> cd src/linux
> make headless

You may have to create object directories (support, brains, sides, simulation)
under src/linux.

This will probably work on other Unixes too.

----- Building under other environments -----

Porting headless mode to other environments should be easy. Tell your
compiler to define HEADLESS as 1.

If you can build Grobots in another environment, we want your diffs
and makefiles (or local equivalent).

See <http://grobots.sourceforge.net/source.html> for info on porting
Grobots to other platforms. We are interested in portability patches,
even incomplete ones.


Have fun.
